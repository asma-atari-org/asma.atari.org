# asma.atari.org - Atari SAP Music Archive
This project contains the sources for the ASMA Website at https://asma.atari.org.<br>
The actual ASMA archive is original in the SVN repository of http://asma.scene.pl.<br>
To build the website, the "asma" folder in the SVN repository must be linked as "public_html/asma".<br>
The link is created by the "bat\checkout.bat" script if it is missing.
