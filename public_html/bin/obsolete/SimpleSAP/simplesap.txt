SimpleSapPlayer for BeOS

This is just a quick 5 minute hatchet job to get a player up and running, very low cpu usage on the sound emulation, good job Adam Bienias. i had a peek at penguinsap, which gave me a few ideas.

The - button goes back 1 song, and it's obvious what the plus one does, :-)

Go here to learn more about SAP, and get some music files to play.

If anyone wants to do a really cool SAP player for BeOS, feel free to do so, i've made the sound bit work, all you have to do is do the interface, :-), i'm thinking of making it into a plugin for CL-Amp and SoundPlay, or if anyone else is up to the job, feel free to do it.
